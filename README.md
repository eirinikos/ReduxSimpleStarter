# ReduxSimpleStarter
The origins of this repo are in Stephen Grider's [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) on React and Redux.

It has begun as a clone of [this repo](https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter) and will evolve as I continue through the course.

Checkout that repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
> git clone https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter.git
> cd ReduxSimpleStarter
> npm install
> npm start
```

I'm relying on Stephen Grider's tutorial as I revisit React in 2018. The commits I make to this repo are meant to document my learning and review process. The motivation for this repo is similar to the motivation for [this Django repo](https://github.com/eirinikos/django-tutorial-mysite); that is, I want to write a handy study journal that my future self can read when she revisits this moment in time.
